## What is InstructLab

InstructLab (Large-scale Alignment for chatBots) is an open source initiative that provides a platform for easy engagement with AI Large Language Models by using the ilab command-line interface (CLI) tool. 
You can use the CLI to work with Merlinite-7b or Granite-7b models to test new skills and knowledge.
Users can then augment the models capabilities by contributing skills and knowledge to the projectâ€™s taxonomy repository on GitHub.
This approach encourages community-driven enhancements without the need for complex model forking or fine-tuning of the model.

## Contributing to InstructLab

When you're ready to start contributing to InstructLab the steps are:

1. Install the ilab CLI.
2. Deploy the model locally.
3. Add skills or knowledge and train to the local model with your data.
4. Create a pull request and add your information to the InstructLab taxonomy.
5. Get reviews on your pull requests

## InstructLab Software License

The InstructLab project as well as the Merlinite-7b and Granite-7b models are distributed under Apache Software License, Version 2.0.

## InstructLab tuning method

InstructLab uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method. 
The tuning method for InstructLab is LAB Method: A synthetic data-based tuning method for models consisting of a taxonomy-driven data curation process, a synthetic data generator, and two-phased training with replay buffers.
The "lab" in InstructLab stands for Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots.

## InstructLab Creators

InstructLab creation was a joint effort by Red Hat and IBM Research. The collaboration between IBM and Red Hat lead to the creation of the InstructLab CLI ilab as well as lots of new innovation to come.
